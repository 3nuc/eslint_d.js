# Changes

## 2.1.0

Make `eslint_d` work out of the box in vim with the syntastic eslint checker.

- Add `--version` and `-v` options
- Do not start server when called with `-h` or `--help`
- Downgrade `optionator` to align with eslint
- Update instructions for vim integration

## 2.0.0

This realease support (almost) all `eslint` options. Check `eslint_d --help`.

Breaking that API already: The `lint` command was removed and in case you're
not passing a control command like `start`, `stop`, `restart` or `status`, the
given options are passed to the linter.

Also, the default output format was changed from `compact` to `stylish` to
align with `eslint`.
